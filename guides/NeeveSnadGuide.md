**As for LV**.

Snad is a sand-like block that instantly grows sugar cane or cacti when it receives a redstone update.

However, it's best to not use timers or any kind of redstone clocks; instead, you should attach a redstone conduit to a block of Snad, and force the connection by **shift-left** clicking the conduit with a Yeta Wrench or a Crescent Hammer, selecting the side you want to connect the conduit to, and clicking Output. After that, install a "Redstone Sensor Filter" to the input side of the conduit GUI.

This will greatly increase the yield of sugar cane as the redstone conduit would emit *a real lot* of redstone updates into Snad, making it grow the cane at almost one layer per less than a second.

You can use a piston and an observer to break the cane early (collect with vacuum chest), then switch to Actually Additions Auto-Breaker which is much superior. (requires you to either loot a void crystal from the Lost Cities or the Nether, or just make one yourself when you reach early MV.

Please, for the love of god, don't forget to void the overflow of the cane. As an easy solution, you can use the Storage Void Upgrade while storing the cane in a drawer. Don't let it overflow and possibly lag/corrupt your world!
