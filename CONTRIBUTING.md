If you want to write a guide for Omnifactory, it's awesome! Feel free to fork the repository, add the guide and submit the PR. This repo is meant to collect all the guides for Omnifactory, so I'll barely even look at your PR before merging it. Similarly, just make a PR if you want to make any changes to your guide after it is added. If I don't acknowledge the PR within a day, pester me on Discord (ConfusedReptile#6830).

There are only a few guidelines in effect right now:
1. Mention the version the guide is for (if at all applicable) and *the author* in the beginning (before the title). Look at [joqr's AE2 For Dummies](https://github.com/RundownRhino/OmnifactoryGuides/blob/1.2.1/guides/AE2ForDummies.md) for an example. That may be a discord tag or some other name - essentially, it's just so that people know who to pester about that guide.
2. Name the guide's file **without any spaces**. I'm using CamelCase myself (example:`AECraftStartProblems`), but you can use underscores (`AE_Craft_Start_Problems`) too if you want. This is needed because the guide will be linked in #omnicompendium, and I've already encountered players who had trouble opening links with spaces, in browsers like Safari.
